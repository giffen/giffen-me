## The Concept

Pull a random major arcana card each day and receive a personalized horoscope based on that card. The twist: the app remembers your past readings and uses them to inform future predictions, creating a sense of continuity and narrative across your readings.

## Learning Objectives

- Flashy, engaging graphics and animations
- Daily login mechanics and user retention
- API integration with ChatGPT for dynamic content generation
- Full app store deployment process (iOS/Android)
- Using historical user data to personalize future AI outputs
- Collecting and leveraging user info (birthday, preferences) for tailored experiences

## Considerations

| Criticism | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Crowded market (Co-Star, Sanctuary, etc.) | Differentiate with "memory" feature—past readings inform future ones |
| Retention drops after novelty fades | Streaks, prophecy chains, birthday personalization creates investment |
| AI content feels hollow to users | Be transparent—position as "AI-interpreted" and lean into personalization |
| Low willingness to pay | Freemium model—gate advanced features, not basic daily pulls |
| App Store discovery is expensive | Growth comes from TikTok/Instagram, not ASO |
