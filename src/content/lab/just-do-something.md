## The Concept

A movement reminder app built on a simple, science-backed truth: **consistent something beats sporadic perfect**. Every 30 minutes during work hours (9-5), desk workers get a prompt for a 1-5 minute micro-workout—jumping jacks, air squats, desk push-ups. Users can swap exercises if inappropriate for the moment or snooze notifications. At day's end, they get a simple report showing completed breaks. The pitch: realistic health benefits without fitness transformation promises. Research shows that breaking up sitting every 30 minutes reduces mortality risk, and that 6 daily reps beat 30 weekly reps done once. Just do something.

## Learning Objectives

- Mobile notification systems that respect context (meetings, focus time)
- Building habit-forming UX around "good enough" rather than perfection
- Creating an exercise library optimized for office environments  
- End-of-day reporting that celebrates consistency over intensity
- Exploring B2B2C model (corporate wellness partnerships)
- iOS-first development and App Store optimization

## Market Validation

- **$10-13B global fitness app market** growing 14-30% annually
- **$53-70B corporate wellness market** with 76% of 50+ employee companies offering programs
- Proven competitors: Wakeout (Apple App of Year 2020, $5/month), Moova (premium subscription)
- **150M+ US desk workers** spending 6-8+ sedentary hours daily
- Research validates 10.6+ hours sitting = 40-60% higher heart failure risk, even with exercise
- Science shows: 5-min breaks/hour improve glucose levels better than single longer sessions

## Considerations

| Criticism | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Market is crowded—Wakeout already won App of the Year | Focus on work-specific simplicity: 20-30 core moves vs. their 2,500 exercises; clearer pricing |
| 30% of users cancel subscriptions within a month | Make free tier genuinely useful; build streak tracking and make skipping feel deliberate |
| Most people ignore reminder apps after 2 weeks | Smart calendar integration; social accountability; science-backed "something beats nothing" messaging |
| Exercise apps are hard to differentiate | Win on UX: dead-simple onboarding, work-appropriate exercises only, no perfectionism required |
| B2B sales cycle is 6-12 months | Launch B2C first to prove retention metrics, then approach corporate wellness with data |
| "Just set a timer" is free alternative | Curated work-friendly exercises with video demos; end-of-day reports; remove all friction |
